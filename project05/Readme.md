========================================

![Translation of shape](http://www.saffronstroke.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/image37.png)

**Objection:** To create a mathematical equation or Algorithm that portrays an image. 

####How it Works
---------------------

* **Step 1** - Enter one set of coordinates of a given shapes, we used both triangle and hexagon shape.  Using matplotlibs.patches
* **Step 2** - Rotate (translate) image by a fixed amount.
* **Step 3** - Enter the given amount how many shape to print out, as well as spacing between each rotation. 



####Content
---------------

* **Driver.py** - The Driver Program
* **Final_print.svg** - File of image being produced
* **Previous print outs** - File containing diffrent pictures with various variations.
