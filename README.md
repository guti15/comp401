### Project One: Bloom Filter
![Bloom Filter](http://img3.douban.com/view/note/large/public/p8006482.jpg)

This filter is great on memorey, as it test whether or not an item is on the set. The Bloom Filter, searches wheather or not an item is on the array, by marking a bit array. Bloom filter usually contain more than one hash functions, marking the Bit array more than once.
The Draw Backs:  This data structure fails to tell us wheather the item is in the array, just the possibility that it 'might be' or 'not in the set'.  For more information, and clarity wikipedia has more detailed information [Bloom Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter).
